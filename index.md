## Welcome to Hatuey Forge!

Greetings! I'm excited to share my journey and projects at the intersection of **Machine Learning**, **Data Visualization**, and **Geospatial Analytics**. This blog serves as a space to delve into the technical details, challenges, and fascinating insights gleaned from working with data, particularly within the real estate domain.

You'll find posts covering:
*   In-depth tutorials on building interactive data visualizations (like my [Puerto Rico Real Estate Recommender](https://hatueyforge.github.io/prlistingrecommender/)).
*   Explorations of machine learning models applied to real-world datasets.
*   Discussions on geospatial analysis techniques and tools.
*   Tips and tricks for developing with Python, JavaScript, and various data frameworks.

My goal is to demystify complex concepts and share practical approaches that you can adapt for your own projects. Whether you're a fellow data enthusiast, a real estate professional, or just curious about how technology can transform data into actionable insights, I hope you find something valuable here.
